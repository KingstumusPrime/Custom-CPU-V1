# Logism Implementation of NAND2Tetris

This "custom" CPU was my next big step after learning about [compiler design](https://github.com/KingstumusPrime/g--). While being custom in the sense I wrote it from scratch I used the [NAND2Tetris](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer) course as a guide but made it in logism instead of their VHDL langauge.
