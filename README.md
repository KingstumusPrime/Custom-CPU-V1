# Logism Implementation of NAND2Tetris

This "custom" CPU was my next big step after learning about [compiler design](https://github.com/KingstumusPrime/g--). While being custom in the sense I wrote it from scratch I used the [NAND2Tetris](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer) course as a guide but made it in logism instead of their VHDL langauge. In addition to having the CPU implemented I also created a simple Python assembler for the HACK assembly language created along with the course. Aside from that I had atemped to modify the CPU in order to include screen functionality but it quickly fell flat when I tried to implement proper timing. While this project is impressive it really existed to create my truly custom CPU also known as [CPU v2]().
